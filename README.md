ever got fucking tired of fucking spammin that space bar till its fuckin broken? i gotchu fam, this script ensures no more destroying that space bar and you can have a pain free experience, and dont jump with it activated at the same time. i recommend having high fps for this, if you have potato pc then turn down your settings or it wont be as effective. note that this is not the most reliable and you'll have to execute it everytime you die.

the preview is the new unreleased versions (like minecaft bedrock lol), it may be buggy
